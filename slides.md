## Practical Dependent Types with Practical Examples

![right](images/IMG_20140622_112406275-MOTION.gif)

^ New, FP lang with DTs

^ Dunno what DT means? DW

^ "Types depend upon values" not insightful, prefer to demonstrate and point out

^ Add a layer of expressiveness, not just about correctness

NICTA: High Assurance Demo

![autoplay loop fit](images/drone.mp4)

^ One motivation is verification, i.e. proving properties about our code

^ e.g NICTA, seL4, OS kernel - prove no overflows, null pointers, memory leaks

^ This is a drone which tries very hard not to crash

^ Proofs in Isabelle about Haskell code which spits out C (costly)

"Adventures in Extraction" - Wouter Swierstra

* Experience report, xmonad in Coq
* "Extraction is not yet mature technology"
* "uses Peano numbers"
* "uses unsafeCoerce (too much)"
* "Blood, Sweat, Shell script"
* "Need another sed script to patch the types that Coq generates"

## [fit] Practical

![left](images/IMG_20140418_124946061-MOTION.gif)

* Dependent types
* Examples

^ More practical situation: write and execute in one language

^ C, JavaScript, LLVM, Java, Ruby, COBOL

^ Disclaimer: Idris is early research and implementation

^ We should write our blogs in Idris, verified Common Markdown, version control?

^ Examples: no sized vectors, things immediately useful
